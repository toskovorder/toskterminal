# Features of Tosk Terminal

## Batch Computation
Tosk Terminal supports batch computations for quantum circuit simulations, entropy modulation, and AI integration. Below is an example of entropy-modulated quantum state initialization.

### Example: Entropy-Modulated State Initialization
The code initializes a quantum state, applies entropy modulation, and measures the resulting state.

```python
from quantum_entropy.qubit_simulator import QubitSimulator

# Initialize a simulator with 3 qubits
simulator = QubitSimulator(3)

# Display the initial state
print("Initial State:", simulator.state)

# Apply entropy modulation
simulator.apply_entropy_modulation(0.1)
print("State after Entropy Modulation:", simulator.state)

# Measure the state
result = simulator.measure_state()
print("Measured State:", result)
```

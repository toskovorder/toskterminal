## Code Examples

### Example 1: Quantum Entropy Modulation

This example demonstrates how Tosk Terminal initializes a quantum state, applies entropy modulation, and measures the resulting state.

```python
from quantum_entropy.qubit_simulator import QubitSimulator

# Step 1: Initialize a quantum simulator with 2 qubits
simulator = QubitSimulator(2)

# Step 2: Display the initial quantum state
print("Initial State:", simulator.state)

# Step 3: Apply entropy modulation with a factor of 0.2
simulator.apply_entropy_modulation(0.2)
print("State after Entropy Modulation:", simulator.state)

# Step 4: Measure the quantum state
measured_state = simulator.measure_state()
print("Measured State:", measured_state)

```
Output:
```
Initial State: [0.707 0.707]
State after Entropy Modulation: [0.682 0.731]
Measured State: 1
```

### Example 2: Entropy-Augmented AI

Below is a demonstration of how the entropy-guided AI system adapts machine learning workflows to enhance performance in uncertain environments.

```python
from ai_integration.entropy_guided_ml import EntropyGuidedML
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification

# Step 1: Generate a synthetic dataset
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, random_state=42)

# Step 2: Initialize the entropy-guided machine learning model
model = EntropyGuidedML(entropy_factor=0.05)

# Step 3: Train the model on the entropy-modulated data
model.train(X, y)

# Step 4: Predict using the trained model
predictions = model.predict(X)
print("Sample Predictions:", predictions[:10])

```
Output:
```
Sample Predictions: [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
```

### Example 3: Quantum Entropy Batch Processing

Tosk Terminal supports batch processing for quantum simulations and entropy state manipulations. This example shows how to initialize multiple quantum circuits and compute entropy-modulated states.

```python
from quantum_entropy.batch_processor import QuantumBatchProcessor

# Step 1: Initialize the batch processor for 4 quantum circuits
batch_processor = QuantumBatchProcessor(num_circuits=4, num_qubits=2)

# Step 2: Apply entropy modulation to all circuits in the batch
batch_processor.apply_entropy_modulation(entropy_factor=0.15)

# Step 3: Measure all quantum states in the batch
measured_states = batch_processor.measure_all()
print("Measured States:", measured_states)

```
Output:
```
Measured States: [0, 3, 1, 2]
```

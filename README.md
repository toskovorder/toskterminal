## Code Examples

### Example 1: Quantum Entropy Modulation

This example demonstrates how Tosk Terminal initializes a quantum state, applies entropy modulation, and measures the resulting state.

```python
from quantum_entropy.qubit_simulator import QubitSimulator

# Step 1: Initialize a quantum simulator with 2 qubits
simulator = QubitSimulator(2)

# Step 2: Display the initial quantum state
print("Initial State:", simulator.state)

# Step 3: Apply entropy modulation with a factor of 0.2
simulator.apply_entropy_modulation(0.2)
print("State after Entropy Modulation:", simulator.state)

# Step 4: Measure the quantum state
measured_state = simulator.measure_state()
print("Measured State:", measured_state)
